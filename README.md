# React Login Form

Welcome to the **React Login Form** project. This is a simple, responsive, and user-friendly login form built with React. The form includes fields for email/username and password, with built-in validation to ensure users input valid information.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**  
  The form is fully responsive and works well across different screen sizes, from mobile devices to desktops.

- **Validation**  
  The form includes built-in validation for both email and password fields:
  - The email field requires a valid email format (example: `user@example.com`) and uses a regular expression (regex) to validate the structure.
  - The password must be between 8 and 16 characters long and must include at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one number, and one special character (such as `@`, `!`, `#`, etc.).

## How to Use

The form is ready to be used in any project. You can easily modify the structure and validation rules based on your requirements. This project is simple to customize and integrate into your own applications.
